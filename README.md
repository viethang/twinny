# twinny

Are you fed up of all of those so called "free" Copilot alternatives with paywalls and signups? Fear not my developer friend! Twinny is the most no-nonsense locally hosted (or api hosted) AI code completion plugin for Visual Studio Code designed to work seamlessly with [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama), [Ollama Web UI](https://github.com/ollama-webui/ollama-webui), [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) and [LM Studio](https://github.com/lmstudio-ai). Like Github Copilot but 100% free and 100% private.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Easy Installation

Install the verified extension via the Visual Studio Code marketplace by clicking [this link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rjmacarthy.twinny) or find the extension in the extensions section of Visual Studio Code.

Twinny is configured to use the Ollama API by default, however you can change this to use llama.cpp, LM Studio or Oobabooga by changing the API provider in the extension settings. You can find the settings inside the extension sidebar by clicking the gear icon inside the twinny sidebar or by searching for `twinny` in the extensions search bar.

Twinny supports the OpenAI API specification so in theory any API should work with Twinny as long as it supports the OpenAI specification.  If you find that isn't the case please open an issue with details of how you are having problems.

When choosing an API provider the port and API path names will be updated automatically based on the provider you choose to use. These options can also be set manually.

The option for chat model name and fim model name are only applicable to Ollama and Oobabooga providers.

When the extension is ready you will see a `ðŸ¤–` icon at the bottom of your code editor indicating that twinny is ready to use.

Enjoy enhanced code completions and chat with twinny! ðŸŽ‰

## Model support

**Fill in the middle (FIM) completions**

- If using Llama the model must support the Llama special tokens.
- If using deepseek use a base model for example `deepseek-coder:base` and `deepseek-coder:6.7b-base-q5_K_M`
- If using stable code `stable-code:code` has been tested and works well.

**Chat**

- All models should work for chat generations but the templates might need editing if using something other than codellama and updated with the special tokens.

## Keyboard shortcuts

| Shortcut                     | Description                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `ALT+\`                      | Trigger inline code completion           |
| `CTRL+SHIFT+t`               | Open twinny sidebar                      |
| `CTRL+SHIFT+/`               | Stop code generation                     | 

## Workspace context

In the settings there is an option called `useFileContext` this will keep track of sessions, keystrokes, visits and recency of visited files in the current workspace.  This can be enabled to help improve the quality of completions, it's turned off by default but I'm considering turning this on by default in the next release.

## Known issues

- If the server settings are incorrectly set chat and fim completion will not work, if this is the case please open an issue with your error message.
- Sometimes a restart of vscode is required for new settings to take effect, please open an issue if you are having problems with this.
- Using file context often causes unreliable completions for FIM because small models get confused when provided with more than one file context.
- See open issues on github to see any known issues that are not yet fixed.
  
If you have a problem with Twinny or have any suggestions please report them on github issues.  Please include your vscode version and OS details in your issue.
